Over the past decade, open scholarship has become a key component of our
increasingly networked world. Open scholarship encompasses open access
to research, open datasets of academic and government material, and open
educational resources. Proponents for open scholarship assert that in
order to reach its full potential research output needs to be widely
accessible to many different communities, instead of locked behind
paywalls or presented in unfindable or incomprehensible formats (Eve
2014; Fitzpatrick 2011, 2019; Willinsky 2006). This idea is gaining
prominence in institutional, governmental, and international contexts as
public calls for accountability grow and library budgets shrink due to
mounting costs of research access.

For several years now, the Implementing New Knowledge Environments
(INKE) Partnership[^1] has considered the concept of *open social
scholarship*: “academic practice that enables the creation,
dissemination, and engagement of open research by specialists and
non-specialists in accessible and significant ways” (INKE Partnership
n.d.). Open social scholarship builds on the already complex and layered
concept of open scholarship. This mode of engagement recognizes that
scholarly communication is more than the mere reproduction and sharing
of data, and pushes into spaces of *social* connection and engagement.
Open social scholarship takes seriously the possibilities of engaging
across publics and working alongside those who are not always considered
to be authoritative knowledge creators. And yet, as Catherine D’Ignazio
and Lauren F. Klein remind their readers in *Data Feminism* (2020), even
activities like crowdsourcing can be fraught with challenges around who
does and does not have the time—and thus, resources—to participate
(180). Charlotte Roh, Harrison W. Inefuku, and Emily Drabinski suggest
“scholarly communications is a series of material practices that could
be constructed otherwise—rooted in equity and justice rather \[than\]
colonization and dominance” (2020, 49). This transformative time for
scholarly communication raises questions around what should be left
behind in the transition from closed, academic-only publishing to more
openly accessible and collaborative methods, while also acknowledging
and drawing on the social aspects of much pre-digital scholarship (see,
e.g., Benkler 2006; Bollier 2006; Borgman 2007; Burke 2000, 2012;
Siemens 2002). Open social scholarship provides opportunities to
reimagine what research and scholarship might be for a present and a
future facing significant challenges. The current problematizing and
reimagining of scholarly communication is crucial, and reflects an
evolving and emerging set of values also connected to open social
scholarship as an idea and mode of activity.

In December 2020, participants at a Canadian–Australian event called
*Engaging Open Social Scholarship* considered many of the issues,
concerns, and hot topics at work in open social scholarship. This
combined event built on previous years’ meetings and discussions of both
the INKE Partnership and the Canadian–Australian Partnership for Open
Scholarship (CAPOS).[^3] *Engaging Open Social Scholarship* represented
the second annual gathering of the CAPOS group and the eighth annual
winter gathering of the INKE Partnership. Due to the ongoing COVID-19
global pandemic, *Engaging Open Social Scholarship* was an online event
spanning three days. This format allowed for over 200 students,
librarians, researchers, and administrators from around the world to
discuss current and future endeavours in, and strategies for, open
social scholarship, including specific deliberations on scholarly
communication, open access, and community engagement. Event presenters
hailed from Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates, the United
Kingdom, and the United States of America, with registered attendees
from all of these nations as well as Belgium, Brazil, Burkina Faso,
Chile, Egypt, India, Lebanon, South Africa, and Turkey. Such a global
constituency provided multiple perspectives on open scholarship
considerations across geographic contexts. This special issue is
representative of some of the key event proceedings and discussions from
*Engaging Open Social Scholarship*.

The INKE Partnership is a North American-based research network with the
goal of fostering open social scholarship, as noted above. For over a
decade, the INKE Partnership has brought together experts and leaders
with the aim of realizing open, inclusive, and publicly engaged
scholarship that serves both academic interests and society at large.
This group includes researchers, partners, librarians, postdoctoral
fellows, graduate students, and research staff from across Canada as
well as Australia. Coordinated by the Canadian Social Knowledge
Institute (C-SKI)[^4] at the University of Victoria, the INKE
Partnership works to address challenges with scholarly communication by
providing broad access to research, community training, public
engagement, and policy recommendations. This public-facing work helps to
make open social scholarship in Canada both viable and usable.

CAPOS is a collaboration between Canadian and Australian researchers,
policy makers, libraries, computing organizations, research groups, and
postsecondary institutions to advance the understanding of, and resolve
crucial issues in, the production, distribution, and engagement of
scholarship that is open and digital. This partnership draws on both
countries’ positive track records of participating in and influencing
the international consideration of open social scholarship issues. CAPOS
works towards implementing elements of open scholarship policy and
practice from the international sphere in national, regional, and local
contexts—work that is possible because of the complementarity of
governmental and academic institutional structures and legal frameworks
in Canada and Australia. In sum, CAPOS aims to make open scholarship
more efficient and more impactful for the specific national contexts of
Canada and Australia, while feeding back into and participating in
larger, global conversations around the creation, sharing, and
preservation of research outputs.

INKE Partnership and CAPOS goals and objectives run through this special
issue, and the 10 articles included can be grouped into the following
categories: *Activities & Initiatives, Community Standards &
Approaches*, and *Proposals for Change*. These categories are
representative of key elements of open social scholarship. Some authors
discuss ongoing projects, studies, or initiatives they are undertaking
in open, digital contexts, while others comment on current or proposed
methods that increase the efficiency or breadth of our shared work.
Still other contributors reflect on their visions for the future of open
scholarship. The first grouping, *Activities & Initiatives*, brings
together authors who undertake open social scholarship on the ground.
[Chris Adamson](../adamson) argues for the value of public scholarship in
contemporary academia and provides insight into a public scholarship
workshop he coordinated with colleagues at the University of South
Dakota. In their paper, [Rachel Starry and Krystal Boehlert](../starry-boehlert) describe the history of a digital scholarship event series hosted
virtually by the authors’ home institution (University of California,
Riverside). The authors outline the evolution of the series as they
attempted to build community remotely during a pandemic, incorporate
participants’ feedback, and plan future iterations of the series.
[Geoffrey Rockwell, Kaylin Land, and Andrew MacDonald](../rockwell) explore 
Spyral, a notebook environment that allows scholars to combine code,
step-by-step instructions in unstructured text, and research outputs for
others to learn from and replicate. They also discuss how this notebook
model promotes collaboration in a way that challenges the idea of
scholarship as a solitary endeavour. In his contribution, [Mark Turin](../turin)
traces the history and open-access approach to monograph publication of
the Open Book Publishers’ World Oral Literature series. In the process,
Turin details some of the exploitative and otherwise problematic
practices of certain academic presses before concluding with a call for
open, equitable, and innovative forms of publication.

The second cluster, *Community Standards & Approaches*, presents work on
how open scholarship is undertaken and where there is room for
improvement. [Lisa Goddard](../goddard) discusses Persistent Identifiers (PIDs),
which are used to provide stable references to an individual's research
publications. She glosses key features, well-known examples of PIDs, and
some of the primary benefits and challenges associated with identifiers
from a variety of research environment perspectives. In their paper,
[Luis Meneses, Lynne Siemens, Ray Siemens, and William R.
Bowen](../meneses) consider best practices for large-scale digital, collaborative
projects, providing concrete examples. In “Political Economy and
Diplomatics of Open Social Scholarship,” [Shawn Martin](../martin) addresses the 
problem of governance in the field of scholarly communication. He brings
theoretical approaches to regulation, professional communication, and
diplomatics (from history, sociology, and information science,
respectively) to bear on current bibliodiversity conversations and
practices.

The third grouping of papers, *Proposals for Change*, draws together
papers that examine where and how open social scholarship could evolve.
 [Danny Kingsley](../kingsley) argues that there are insufficient training
opportunities in the realm of open scholarship. One strategic approach
to this issue, Kingsley argues, would be to develop an international
curriculum that standardizes open scholarship skill training, with a
focus on reproducibility as well as research quality and integrity.
[Amanda Lawrence](../lawrence) takes issue with the term *grey literature,* arguing
that it is too general and too broad to be useful. Such generic
categorization is a challenge to the viability of varied knowledge
outputs, claims Lawrence, since “without appropriate terminology for
this diverse publishing ecosystem it is overlooked and therefore not
managed effectively and efficiently with appropriate standards and
infrastructure.” Reflecting on her featured talk from *Engaging Open
Social Scholarship,* [Roxanne Missingham](../missingham) suggests that graduate
theses and dissertations should become much more prominent in the
current digital scholarly communication ecosystem, including through
open access publication.

As the contributions included in this special issue demonstrate, there
are many different facets of open social scholarship. Across CAPOS and
the INKE Partnership, researchers, librarians, academic staff, students,
and emerging scholars are considering what it means to do their work
more openly and more socially. In *Generous Thinking,* Kathleen
Fitzpatrick writes: “Making our work more available is the first step in
creating a richer connection with readers outside our inner circles,
readers who might not only care about what we do but be encouraged to
support it” (2019, 137). The contributors included here take
availability and access seriously and build off of such availability and
access to foster those richer connections across and among varied
communities. Such commitment is critical for an increase in engagement
with open social scholarship, now and in the future.
