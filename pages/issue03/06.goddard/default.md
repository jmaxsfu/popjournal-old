abstract: 'Persistent Identifiers, or PIDs, are emerging as a key aspect of research infrastructure. They act as connective tissue, exposing the relationships between different entities that make up the research ecosystem. One of the major promises of PIDs is that they can help to reduce researcher administrative burden by automating the exchange of information that currently relies on manual entry. This benefit is not well understood by researchers, in part because it can only be realized when PIDs are adopted by a critical mass of researchers, funders, and research administrators. This article will outline the defining characteristics of identifiers; articulate the major benefits of research identifiers; discuss some of the main implementation challenges; provide an overview of existing and emerging identifiers; and summarize some key recommendations for expediting the adoption of PIDs around the globe.'
