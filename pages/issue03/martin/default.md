abstract: 'This review essay investigates three areas of academic study in order to better answer the question of what the political economy of open social scholarship might look like in the future. By synthesizing research in the areas of history, sociology, and diplomatics (a subdiscipline within the field of information science), this article suggests that an integration of the three will be necessary in order to better address the ways scholarship should be regulated in the future. Fundamentally, scholarly communication is about “documents” and how they are evaluated and authenticated over time. Diplomatics is a discipline grounded in history that studies documents, and, when combined with the insights of history and sociology, can perhaps provide a useful theoretical framework for understanding the political economy of scholarly communication.'
