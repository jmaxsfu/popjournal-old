abstract: 'Online digital projects can become inherently complex, both in their development and in their long-term maintenance, and as products of collaboration between a humanities researcher and developer. There are positive aspects of this collaboration which support the development of a successful project. However, structures and policies must be in place to achieve the project’s objectives. This article will consider these within the context of two specific projects through Iter Community. The supporting structures include the development of workplans and common interests between the researcher and developer, communication channels, and measurements of success.'
